    "Internally the memory is divided in small pieces, like the drawers of a filing cabinet, and the computer assings a numeric adress to each of those drawers. So, for instance, we could tell the computer to store the number 42 in the address 00000100, but it would be very cumbersome to use these numeric addresses, so, instead, the we use [variables](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variable_(computer_science)), names that we create, to refer to the memory locations and contents.\n",

    "In different programming languages and expressions a variable can refer to the value stored or to the memory address ([pointer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pointer_(computer_programming))).
