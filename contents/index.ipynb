    "# An introduction to programming using Python\n",
    "\n",
    "This is an introduction to Python aimed to students with no prior programming experience.\n",
    "There are many great introductions to Python, but we thought that it would be useful for us to create a new one that:\n",
    "\n",
    "  - It relies mainly in examples and exercises.\n",
    "  - It runs those examples and exercises directly in the web, avoiding the need to install Python in the first day of class.\n",
    "\n",
    "We decided to try this approach after following the [rustlings](https://github.com/rust-lang/rustlings/) path, an exercise set aimed at teaching the Rust programming language.\n",
    "Rustlings assumes that the student has previously read the [Rust introductory book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/).\n",
    "For this course we have decided to add resources to read at the end of each exercise set, so, the student could start by reading these resources, but we have also included examples to ease the use of this course in practical sessions with students with no previous knowlegde of the theory.\n",
