So far we have been writting very small pieces of code, but in most reallistic projects we will need to structure our code, we will have to divide our software in pieces, and [functions](https://docs.python.org/3/glossary.html#term-function) are one of the main ways of accomplishing that.

You can think on a programming function like in a kind of mathematical function, that takes some parameters and returns a result (although as we will see both the parameters and the result are optional).

```{mermaid}
flowchart LR
  radius(["radius"])-- calc_area -->area(["area"])
```

When we are programming what we do is to manipulate data.
Think in a program as a series of manipulations on the data that is stored in memory.
We take some pieces of data, for example the radius of a circle, and we do a action, like calculating the area.
So we need ways of defining that data, and for that we use [types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_type) (and [classes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming))), and we create [functions]((https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Function_(computer_programming))) (and [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming))) to manipulate that data.

Imagine data as things/objects or properties of those objects, and functions as actions that act on the data.
For example, we have some data, the *radius* of a circle, we apply an action to it, **calc_area**, and we obtain a new piece of data, the *area*.
Both radius and area are pieces of data, whereas cacl_area is an action, a verb.

## Definition and calling

In Python functions are defined by using the **def** keyword.

```{pyodide}
def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
```

If you run the previous piece of code you won't see any result. Once you define a function, the function will be ready to be used, but in order to use it you need to call it.
We call a function by using parentheses (**()**).

```{pyodide}
def say_hello():
    print("Hello")

say_hello()
```

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: fix_funct_block
def say_hello()
    print("Hi!")
    print("Bye!")

say_hello
```
::: { .solution exercise="fix_funct_block" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false"}
```{pyodide}
def say_hello():
    print("Hi!")
    print("Bye!")

say_hello()
```
:::
:::


The lines that belong to the function are the lines indented after the function definition line. Those are the lines in the function block [block](../control_flow/block.qmd).
Fix the following code:

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: fix_funct_block2
def say_hello()
    print("Hello, we're in the function!")
    print("Not in the function")

say_hello()
say_hello()
```
::: { .solution exercise="fix_funct_block2" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false"}
```{pyodide}
def say_hello()
    print("Hello, we're in the function!")
print("Not in the function")

say_hello()
say_hello()
```
:::
:::

It is important to understand how the flow, the order in which the lines are executed, is changed by the function.
Once you call the function the flow goes into the function until the function ends. At that point the flow is sent back to the line that called the function.

Try to fill out the numbers in the prints of the following code to track the flow of execution.
In which order will be the lines executed?

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: function_flow

print("This will be print number: 0")

def say_hello():
    print("This will be print number: #")
    print("Hello")
    print("This will be print number: #")

print("This will be print number: #")
say_hello()
print("This will be print number: 4")
```
::: { .solution exercise="variable_name" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false"}
```{pyodide}
print("This will be print number: 0")

def say_hello():
    print("This will be print number: 2")
    print("Hello")
    print("This will be print number: 3")

print("This will be print number: 1")
say_hello()
print("This will be print number: 4")
```

## Scopes and arguments

The code inside a function has its own variables, and those are not shared between functions and between the function and the rest of the code.
To use a value inside a value, usually, we pass the variable to the function.
To understand what do we mean when we say that we *pass* some data to a function we need to understand the concept of the [scope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_(computer_science)).

When we are programming we store and access data in memory.
As we have seen, we refer to the data stored in memory by using variables.
We could think that those variables, once they are created, are available in every part of our program.
If you used that approach when you tried to build a program with more than a few lines of code, it would become very difficult to track which part of the program had changed a variable.
So maintining those large programs would be very difficult.

The scope defines where in the code a variable is available, and functions define their own scope.
In a computer program not all data is available to every part of the code.
For instance, the variables that are defined inside a function are not available outside of the function.

```{pyodide}
def print_numbers():
    number1 = 42
    number2 = 7
    print(number1)
    print(number2)

print_numbers()
# The next line will fail
print(number1)
print(number2)
```

We say that the variables defined in the function are in the function scope, that means that they are not available ouside of the function.

```{pyodide}
def say_hello():
    name = "John"
    print(1, name)

say_hello()
print(2, name)
```

We get a "'name' is not defined error" because the variable name was created inside the say_hello function, so in the say_hello scope, and is not available outside.
A variable can only be used when is in the current scope.
It is said that the function has a local scope in which its variables are available.

### Global scope

Be careful because Python also has a global scope, and if you create the variable outside the function it will be available inside. We can use the variables defined in the global scope inside any function.

```{pyodide}

GLOBAL_GREETING = "Hello!"

def print_greeting():
    print(GLOBAL_GREETING)

print_greeting()
print(GLOBAL_GREETING)
```

In this case the variable name has been created in the global scope, it is a global variable available everywhere.
In general, avoid creating global variables, specially if they are not inmutable constants.
As a general rule the use of the global scope is discouraged, try not to use it.
If you think you need a global variable, think twice, in most cases is better not to use them.
This is an advanced topic, but here's a tip for the future you, to keep states it might be much better to use objects, instances of a class, that global variables. For now, this is too advanced.
Just remember, try very hard not to use global varibles, although you can allow some exceptions with some inmutable ones used for global configurations.
It is common to use this kind of global variables, inmutables and related to configuration, and, by convention, in Python, people name them using all caps variable names.

```{pyodide}
I_AM_A_GLOBAL_VARIABLE = 'be_very_careful'

def some_function():
    print(I_AM_A_GLOBAL_VARIABLE)

some_function()
```

Python discourages some uses of the use the global scope, and the behaviour of these variables is atypical.

```{pyodide}
GLOBAL_GREETING = "Hello!"

def print_greeting():
    GLOBAL_GREETING = "Hi!"
    print(GLOBAL_GREETING)

print(GLOBAL_GREETING)
print_greeting()
print(GLOBAL_GREETING)
```

```{pyodide}
# This code will fail
ACCUMULATED_SUM = 0

def sum_one():
    # This error could be fixed, but you better not
    ACCUMULATED_SUM += 1
    print(ACCUMULATED_SUM)

sum_one()
print(ACCUMULATED_SUM)
```

### Passing data to a function, function arguments

So, when the function requires some data to carry an action, we should pass that data explictly to the function.
For instance, if we want a function to print a personalized greeting, it could need the name of the person.

```{pyodide}
def say_hello(name):
    # The data that we have passed is now in the local scope of the function
    print("Hello", name)

# person is a variable defined in the global scope
person = "Jane"
say_hello(person) # <- we are passing the variable person to the function
```

Passing data to a function is easy, but a lot is going on under the hood:

1. We have created a text string ("Jane"). That means that Python has created and stored a object of type str in memory.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    subgraph main [ ]
    person:::invisible
    end
    subgraph say [ ]
    name:::invisible
    end
    Memory:::memory
    subgraph Memory
    Jane["'Jane'"]
    end
    person --> Jane
    name --> Jane
    classDef variable fill:#f96
    classDef invisible opacity:0%
    classDef memory fill:#ccc
    linkStyle 0,1 stroke-width:0px
```

2. We have assigned the variable person to that string, so now person refers to that str object stored in memory.

```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    subgraph main [global scope]
    person
    end
    subgraph say [ ]
    name:::invisible
    end
    Memory:::memory
    subgraph Memory
    Jane["'Jane'"]:::variable
    end
    person --> Jane
    name --> Jane
    classDef invisible opacity:0%
    classDef memory fill:#ccc
    linkStyle 1 stroke-width:0px
```

3. When we call the function we pass the reference of the object, the variable person, to the function.
4. The function receives the reference to the str object and assigns to it a new reference, in this case called name. It is very important to understand that although the object is the same, the "Jane" string, we have created a new reference to it, the new variable name.
```{mermaid}
flowchart TB
    subgraph main [global scope]
    person
    end
    subgraph say [say_hello scope]
    name
    end
    Memory:::memory
    subgraph Memory
    Jane["'Jane'"]
    end
    person --> Jane
    name --> Jane
    classDef invisible opacity:0%
    classDef memory fill:#ccc
```

## return

Scopes have also to be taken into account when getting a result out of the function.

```{pyodide}
def calc_rect_area(width, height):
    area = width * height

calc_rect_area(2, 3)
# The next line will fail because area is not available in the global scope
# The variable area belongs to the scope of the function.
print("The area is:", area)
```

If we want to get data out of the function we use the [return](https://docs.python.org/3/reference/simple_stmts.html#the-return-statement) statement.
Let's see how we can return data to the caller.

```{pyodide}
def calc_rect_area(width, height):
    area = width * height
    return area

result = calc_rect_area(2, 3)
print("The area is:", result)

a, b = 4, 2
print("The second area is: ", calc_rect_area(a, b))
```

We use the return statement to return a value generated in the function to the caller. Again, like in the arguments passed to the function, the caller will receive a new reference to the value stored in memory that can assign to a new variable.
return is used to move a result in memory between scopes.
For instance, in the previous example there is a variable, inside the function, named area, but in the first call we store the reference in a variable named result. area and result are two variables, two references to the same value stored in memory, but they are variables that belong to different scopes.
In this case area belongs to the scope of the calc_rect_area function and result to the global scope.

Fix the following code

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: fix_triangle
from math import sqrt
def calc_triangle_area(side1, side2, side3):
    semiperimeter = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2.0
    area2 = semiperimeter * (semiperimeter - side1) * (semiperimeter - side2) * (semiperimeter - side3)
    area = sqrt(area2)

print(calc_triangle_area(4, 5, 3))
```
::: { .hint exercise="fix_triangle"}
::: { .callout-note collapse="false"}
Does the function return something?
:::
:::
::: { .solution exercise="fix_triangle" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false"}
```{pyodide}
from math import sqrt
def calc_triangle_area(side1, side2, side3):
    semiperimeter = (side1 + side2 + side3) / 2.0
    area2 = semiperimeter * (semiperimeter - side1) * (semiperimeter - side2) * (semiperimeter - side3)
    area = sqrt(area2)
    return area

print(calc_triangle_area(4, 5, 3))
```

Write a function that returns "odd" or "even" depending on the number that we pass.

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: odd_or_even

def is_odd_or_even(number):
    ...

print("3 is", is_odd_or_even(3))
print("6 is", is_odd_or_even(6))

```
::: { .solution exercise="odd_or_even" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false"}

```{pyodide}
def is_odd_or_even(number):
    remainder = number % 2
    if remainder:
        return "odd"
    else:
        return "even"

print("3 is", is_odd_or_even(3))
print("6 is", is_odd_or_even(6))
```

Write a program with two functions, one that transforms from Fahrenheit to Celsius, and another one from Celsius to Fahrenheit.

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: fahrenheit
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp):
    celsius = (temp - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0)

def celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp):
    fahrenheit = (temp * 9.0 / 5.0) + 32

celsius = 30
fahrenheit = 

fahrenheit = 100
celsius = 
```
::: { .solution exercise="fahrenheit"}
::: { .callout-note collapse="false"}
```{pyodide}
def fahrenheit_to_celsius(temp):
    celsius = (temp - 32.0) * (5.0 / 9.0)
    return celsius

def celsius_to_fahrenheit(temp):
    fahrenheit = (temp * 9.0 / 5.0) + 32
    return fahrenheit

celsius = 30
fahrenheit = celsius_to_fahrenheit(celsius)
print(f"{celsius} celsius in fahrenheit is: {fahrenheit}")

fahrenheit = 100
celsius = fahrenheit_to_celsius(fahrenheit)
print(f"{fahrenheit} fahrenheit in celsius is: {celsius}")
```

Define a function that reverses a list, like the reversed [funtion](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html#reversed).

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: reversed
def my_reversed(a_list):
    ...
    return reversed_list

reversed_list = my_reversed([1, 4, True, "Hi", None])
print(reversed_list)
```
::: { .hint exercise="reversed"}
::: { .callout-note collapse="false"}
Remember that indexing has the posibility of reversing using -1 as the step (some_sequence[::-1]).
:::
:::
::: { .solution exercise="reversed"}
::: { .callout-note collapse="false"}
```{pyodide}
def my_reversed(a_list):
    return a_list[::-1]
reversed_list = my_reversed([1, 4, True, "Hi", None])
print(reversed_list)
```
:::
:::

## Function calls are independent

Note also that each time that the function returns, its scope, the variables created inside the function and available to it, is erased, so each call will be independent.
Once a return is executed in a function, the function returns and its scope is destroyed with all its variables.

```{pyodide}
def calc_rect_area(width, height):
    area = width * height
    return area

result = calc_rect_area(2, 3)
print("The area is:",result)

a, b = 4, 2
print("The second area is: ", calc_rect_area(a, b))
```

What would be the result of executing the following code and why?

```{pyodide}
#| exercise: several_returns

def funct1():
    return ("Hi")
    return ("Bye")

print(funct1())
print(funct1())

```
::: { .solution exercise="several_returns" }
::: { .callout-tip collapse="false"}

Everytime we call a function a new scope with new data is created and the function starts its execution in its first line and ends its execution once it encounters the first return.
That's why no matter how many time we call this function it will always return "Hi" and "Bye" will be never reached.

## Methods

So far we haven't talked about [clases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class_(computer_programming)) and their instances, the [objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object_(computer_science)), because they are a slightly more advanced topic related to [Object-oriented programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming) (OOP).

Python is a object oriented language, in fact, in Python almost everything is an object.
And although we are not going to discuss this topic yet, it is important to understand the concept and use of [methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Method_(computer_programming)), the object "functions".
In fact we have already used methods when dealing with strings.

```{pyodide}
s = "hello"
s = s.upper()
print(s)
```

upper is a method, a function associated with an object.
In this case the object is the string "hello" and upper is a function that acts on that object.
By convention functions associated to objects are called methods.
So upper is a method, a function associated to the objects of type str.
You can think on a method like on a function that has as its first argument the given object.
If upper were a standard function, the previous code would be:

```
s = "hello"
s = upper(s)
print(s)
```

Something similar to that would work if upper were a normal function but, instead, upper is a method associated to an object, so the syntax is different, we use a dot after the object, then the name of the method/function, and then the language makes sure that the object is passed as the first argument to this method.

If you want to understand Python you need to learn about objects, classes, methods and properties, because Python is a deeply object-oriented language, but this is a topic that we can leave for later.

## Anonymous functions, lambdas

In Python, and many other programming languages, we can create anonymous functions, a function with no name.
This is a more abstract idea, but they are used quite commonly in Python, so it would be nice, at least, that you could recognized them.

In Python anonymous functions are created with the [lambda](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions) statement.
lambdas are usually very small functions, just one line, and they are used as parameters for other functions.
For instance, they are very common in as the key argument to the sorted function.

```{pyodide}

words = ['Hi', 'my', 'name', 'is', 'Yoda']
sorted_words = sorted(words, key=lambda word: word.lower())
print(sorted_words)

# The equivalent code with a fully fledged function would be:

def to_lower(word):
    return word.lower()

sorted_words = sorted(words, key=to_lower)
print(sorted_words)

# Both versions are completely equivalent,
# but the lambda version is more compact and that's why is commonly used
```

You can learn more about [lambdas](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/controlflow.html#lambda-expressions) in the official documentation or in [Real Python](https://realpython.com/python-lambda/).
