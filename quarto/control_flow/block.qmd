# Block

A block of code is a set of statements, functions or instructions that are grouped together.
In most programming languages the [blocks of code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Block_(programming)) are created by using curly braces (**{}**). For instance, in C the statements executed when a test condition is met would be written as:

```
if (testCondition) {
   // statements
}
```

In Python a block of code is created by using indentation.

```{pyodide}
a = 42

if a == 42:
    # This is the first line of the block
    print("This is the answer to")
    print("life, the universe, and everything else")
    # This is the last line of the block

print("We are outside the block of code defined by if")

```

- In the if and for the code starts with a colon (**:**)
- The next line after the colon should be indented
- The block ends when the indentation goes back to the previous level.

The standard is to create the indentation by using four spaces.
