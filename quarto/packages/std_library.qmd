There are many packages available in the default Python installation.
We have already used some of them, like pathlib.
You can find a [list](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) with all of them in the official documentation.
Here we are just going to mention a couple as an example.

## Resources

- [Standard library](https://docs.python.org/3/library/index.html) official documentation.

## shutil

The [shutil](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html) module allow us to copy and delete files and directories.
[copy](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copy) copies files, and [copytree](https://docs.python.org/3/library/shutil.html#shutil.copytree) directories.
Remember that in the [pathlib](https://docs.python.org/3/library/pathlib.html) module there was more functionality to create an delete files and directories.

## subprocess

[subprocess](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html) allows you to run programs from Python.
The easiest way to use it is its [run](https://docs.python.org/3/library/subprocess.html#subprocess.run) function.
