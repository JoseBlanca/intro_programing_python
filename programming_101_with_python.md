# Introduction

Why programming?

- data analysis

How can you learn:

- There's only one way, practice:
  - course
  - tutorials
  - project

Why Python:

Python drawbacks:

- speed
    - python is slow
    - VCF parsing times
- mobile
- GUI

# Types

## Theory: Data and execution in the computer

- The computer only store numbers, so it needs to know the type of the variable.

### Exercise

Print the binary representation of an integer.

Print the ASCII byte of a character, and then its binary representation.

## Basic types in python: str, int, float, bool, None

### Exercise

Create variable of different types and print them along with its type.

## Python its dinamic

### Exercise

Create a variable that first holds an int and then an str

## String: single, double and triple quotes

## Type casting

### Exercise

Transform int -> str, str -> int, str -> bool, int ->

Which numbers and str are True and which are False.

# Operations

## Aritmethic with numbers

### Exercise

Operators: + - * /

Int, int

float, float

float and int, which type do we get? And int, int with division?

## More operators, integer division: % //

## +=, -=, *=, /=

## Boolean operators: and, or, not

This will serve later as a preample to the if statement

### Exercise: create the truth tables for and or and not

## Operations with str: + & str * int

str * int will serve as a preamble for [0] * 10

# f-strings

# code blocks

# Control flow: if

>= ==

# Compound types: list

# Control flow: for

## break

## continue

## nested loops

## enumerate

# Iterables and iterators

range()

# Compound types: dict

dict.items()

# variables 2

## a, b == 1, 2

## mutables e inmutables

## variables are references

## variable naming conventions

# Functions

## Introduce that there are methods

## function naming conventions

# Running Python locally

VSC and uv

# Working with files

# Modules and packages

# std library modules

# Data analysis python modules

# Generators
